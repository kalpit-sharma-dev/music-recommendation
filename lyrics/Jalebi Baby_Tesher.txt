Jason derulo!

Tesher!

Sheesh

You know I came here for the cake

Liquor and the money ain't the

Only thing I chase now

She ain't see the stars in the wraith

Soon as she got in that motherfu*ker,

Had her face down

That my type, that my type

My sweetie

Could be wifey if she freaky

Hell of a night, blowing money like monopoly

I'm a dog, kill the kitty no apology

I know that you wanna get crazy, crazy

Shawty take it slow then cheti, cheti

Come on baby be my jalebi baby

Aye!

Baby let me me see it

Jalebi baby

Jalebi I,

I know the things, the things that you like

I know the things, the things that you like

Tell me how you feel

Lookin' like a movie star doing it for reels

Lookin' like a snack, lookin' like a whole meal

Gucci and chanel with your red bottom heels

Ice drip, like paani

Ban ja tu meri rani

Shawty bad, she my deewani mastani

Light it up from hollywood to mohali

Tesher and derulo it's a worldwide party

I know that you wanna get crazy, crazy

Shawty take it slow then cheti, cheti

Come on baby be my jalebi baby
